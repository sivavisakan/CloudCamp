<h1>Pittsburgh</h1>
<p>Pittsburgh is a huge city with several district articles containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife and accommodation listings â€” consider printing them all.
Pittsburgh is a city of about 350,000 in Allegheny County, at the center of the Pittsburgh Region in southwestern Pennsylvania; the population of its metropolitan area is about 2.4 million. It is situated at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers, which meet to form the Ohio River. Pittsburgh's unique terrain has resulted in an unusual city design and a hodge-podge of unique neighborhood "pockets" with diverse ethnic and architectural heritage. Pittsburgh has a rich history and, for its size, an unusual array of cultural treasures, largely thanks to the wealth that was generated when Pittsburgh was a hub of industry.
The pleasure of Pittsburgh remains a well-kept secret. Though not built up by reputation, the city's unique combination of bridges, steep hills, and broad rivers make it one of the most naturally scenic cities in the country. Cheap food and beer abound in this true sports town and the locals are amazingly friendly.</p>
